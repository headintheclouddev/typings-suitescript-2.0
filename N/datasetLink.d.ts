/**
 * Load the N/datasetLink module to link datasets. When you link two datasets, you can use data from both datasets in your workbooks.
 *
 * The N/datasetLink module lets you logically link two datasets and use data from both datasets in your workbook visualizations (such as pivots).
 * Linking datasets is useful when you cannot use joins in the SuiteAnalytics Workbook UI or the Workbook API to join record types explicitly.
 * Linking datasets does not merge or join the datasets.
 * Instead, you specify an expression (which usually represents a column that shares common data between the two datasets, such as a date), and this expression is used to link the datasets.
 * After datasets are linked, you can access all of the data in both datasets to use in workbook visualizations.
 * For example, when you create a pivot in a workbook, you can specify a linked dataset (as a datasetLink.DatasetLink object) to use as the data source for the pivot.
 * You can use fields in both datasets to create data dimensions, data measures, sections, and other elements of the pivot.
 *
 * For more information about linking datasets in SuiteAnalytics Workbook, see Dataset Linking in SuiteAnalytics Workbook.
