/**
 * Load the N/piremoval module to remove personal information (PI) from system notes, workflow history, and specific field values.
 * Use the N/piremoval module to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), specifically the right to be forgotten.
 * You can remove personal information from system notes only, or you can also remove workflow history and field values on the record.
 * Entity records, transactions, and custom records are supported.
 *
 * You can use the piremoval.createTask(options) method to create a PI removal task, or use piremoval.loadTask(options) to load an existing PI removal task.
 * Both of these methods return a piremoval.PiRemovalTask object that represents the task.
 * Create a piremoval.PiRemovalTask object for each record type that requires removal of personal information.
 * Use the PiRemovalTask.save() method to save the task, then use the PiRemovalTask.run() method to process the task and remove the personal information.
 *
 * You can use the piremoval.getTaskStatus(options) method to check the status of a submitted PI removal task.
 * This method returns a piremoval.PiRemovalTaskStatus object that describes the current status of the removal task.
 * The piremoval.PiRemovalTaskStatus object uses an iterator to provide a list of log entries in the PiRemovalTaskStatus.logList object.
 *
 * To use the N/piremoval module, the following requirements must be met:
 * - Remove Personal Information Create permission is required to create a PI removal task.
 * - Remove Personal Information Run permission is required to run a PI removal task.
