 For scheduled script deployments that continue to use queues, use runtime.queueCount. With the introduction of SuiteCloud Processors, map/reduce script deployments and new scheduled script deployments no longer use queues, but pre-existing scheduled script deployments continue to use queues until the queues are removed (see SuiteCloud Processors â€“ Supported Task Types).
 Be aware that the number of processors available may not be the same as the number of queues available. For more information, see SuiteCloud Plus Settings.
